# IMDb quicklist

IMDb quicklist allows you to build up a temporary list of movies to compare them and decide what you will watch.

## Getting started:

First, run `npm` to install necessary depencies.

While in development mode, we'll use [brunch](http://brunch.io):

```shell
brunch watch -s
```

Brunch will join every script and stylesheet togather, monify them and place everything in `public/`. See `config.js` for more information.

The `app.js` is the production static server.
